                    Hey Folks my name is Prabhjyot Gambhir and I am a full stack developer. I am a full stack by choice not by profession, because I just love doing everything. I beleive in Jack of all trades master of none.
                    Because I don't need to be best at 1 and just wait for that skill set to rust, I want to explore, find possible options, survive and if i seek perfection then i leave behind experience. One thing which i find good About
                    me is that if you give me a task, and I don't know how to do it, I will be honest and ask for more time to explore and learn. But that's what we do in real life right ?
                    I may be blunt or straight forward, but I am loyal, if I chose you then I will be there for you 24 hours, because that's what I do.
                    Challenges excite me, staying idle frights me!
